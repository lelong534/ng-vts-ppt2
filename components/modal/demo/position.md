  en-US: To customize the position of modal
---

## en-US

You can use `vtsCentered`,`style.top` or other styles to set position of modal dialog.

> **NOTE** Due to Angular's style isolation, you may need to override the NgZorro style with `:: ng-deep` within a custom style if `encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None` is not included in the Component
